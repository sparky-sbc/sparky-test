# SH1106 / SSD1306 OLED Driver (only tested with SH1106).

I forked the original and made some minor changes, to make it work with sparky

Interfacing OLED matrix displays with the SH1106 (or SSD1306) driver in Python using

The SH1106 display is 128x64 pixels, and the board is _tiny_,

## Pre-requisites

This was tested with sparky volumio image

Install some packages(most should be already installed):

    $ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools python-smbus python-pip python-dev python-imaging

Next check that the device is communicating properly:

    $ i2cdetect -y 2
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
    00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3c -- -- --
    40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

# Installing the Python Package

From the bash prompt, enter:

    $ sudo python setup.py install

This will install the python files in `/usr/local/lib/python2.7`
making them ready for use in other programs.

# Software Display Driver

The screen can be driven with python using the _oled/device.py_ script.
There are two device classes and usage is very simple if you have ever
used [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or PIL.

First, import and initialise the device:

```python
from oled.device import ssd1306, sh1106
from oled.render import canvas
from PIL import ImageFont, ImageDraw

# substitute sh1106(...) below if using that device
device = ssd1306(port=2, address=0x3C)
```

The display device should now be configured for use. The specific `ssd1306` or 
`sh1106` classes both expose a `display()` method which takes a 1-bit depth image. 
However, for most cases, for drawing text and graphics primitives, the canvas class
should be used as follows:

```python
with canvas(device) as draw:
    font = ImageFont.load_default()
    draw.rectangle((0, 0, device.width, device.height), outline=0, fill=0)
    draw.text(30, 40, "Hello World", font=font, fill=255)
```

The `canvas` class automatically creates an [ImageDraw](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/ImageDraw.html) 
object of the correct dimensions and bit depth suitable for the device, so you
may then call the usual Pillow methods to draw onto the canvas.

As soon as the with scope is ended, the resultant image is automatically
flushed to the device's display memory and the ImageDraw object is
garbage collected.

Run the demos in the example directory:

    $ python examples/demo.py
    $ python examples/sys_info.py
    $ python examples/pi_logo.py
    $ python examples/maze.py

Note that `python-dev` (apt-get) and `psutil` (pip) are required to run the `sys_info.py`
example. See [install instructions](https://github.com/rm-hull/ssd1306/blob/master/examples/sys_info.py#L3-L7)
for the exact commands to use.
