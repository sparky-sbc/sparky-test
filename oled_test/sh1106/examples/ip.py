# OLEDip.py
 
# Meant for use with the Raspberry Pi and an Adafruit monochrome OLED display!
 
# This program interfaces with the OLED display in order to print your current IP address to it. The program trys
# several methods in order to accquire an IP address. For example if you are using a WiFi dongle your IP will be 
# different to when you are using a Ethernet cable. This program tests for both and if it can not detect one prints:
# 'NO INTERNET!' to the display. This code is perfect to run on boot when you want to find your Pi's IP address for
# SSH or VNC.
 
# This was coded by The Raspberry Pi Guy!
